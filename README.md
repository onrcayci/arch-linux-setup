# Dotfiles

Various configuration files that I have prepared for various Linux tools.

## Where to put which file

- `.tmux.conf` -> `$HOME`
- `.vimrc` -> `$HOME` or `$HOME/.vim`
- `.Xresources` -> `$HOME`
- Anything under the `.config` directory -> `$HOME/.config`
		- `.config/redshift` -> some ditributions require the file under this directory to be put directly to `$HOME/.config` rather than `$HOME/.config/redshift`
